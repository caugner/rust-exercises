# Getting it Configured

At this stage the device will be in the `Address` stage. It has been identified and enumerated by the host but cannot yet be used by host applications. The device must first move to the `Configured` state before the host can start, for example, HID communication or send non-standard requests over the control endpoint.

Windows will enumerate the device but not automatically configure it after enumeration. Here's what you should do to force the host to configure the device.

## Linux and macOS

Nothing extra needs to be done if you're working on a Linux or macOS host. The host will automatically send a `SET_CONFIGURATION` request so proceed to the `SET_CONFIGURATION` section to see how to handle the request.

## Windows

After getting the device enumerated and into the idle state, open the Zadig tool (covered in the setup instructions; see the top README) and use it to associate the nRF52840 USB device to the WinUSB driver. The nRF52840 will appear as a "unknown device" with a VID and PID that matches the ones defined in the `common` crate

Now modify the `usb-descriptors` command within the `xtask` package to "open" the device -- this operation is commented out in the source code. With this modification `usb-descriptors` will cause Windows to send a `SET_CONFIGURATION` request to configure the device. You'll need to run `cargo xtask usb-descriptors` to test out the correct handling of the `SET_CONFIGURATION` request.

## SET_CONFIGURATION

The SET_CONFIGURATION request is sent by the host to configure the device. Its configuration according to section 9.4.7. of the [USB specification][usb_spec] is:

- `bmrequesttype` is **0b00000000**
- `brequest` is **9** (i.e. the SET_CONFIGURATION Request Code, see table 9-4 in the USB spec)
- `wValue` contains the requested configuration value
- `wIndex` and `wLength` are 0, there is no `wData`

[usb_spec]: https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-20-specification

✅ To handle a SET_CONFIGURATION, do the following:

- If the device is in the `Default` state, you should stall the endpoint because the operation is not permitted in that state.

- If the device is in the `Address` state, then
  - if `wValue` is 0 (`None` in the `usb` API) then stay in the `Address` state
  - if `wValue` is non-zero and valid (was previously reported in a configuration descriptor) then move to the `Configured` state
  - if `wValue` is not valid then stall the endpoint

- If the device is in the `Configured` state, then read the requested configuration value from `wValue`
  - if `wValue` is 0 (`None` in the `usb` API) then return to the `Address` state
  - if `wValue` is non-zero and valid (was previously reported in a configuration descriptor) then move to the `Configured` state with the new configuration value
  - if `wValue` is not valid then stall the endpoint

In all the cases where you did not stall the endpoint (by returning `Err`) you'll need to acknowledge the request by starting a STATUS stage.

✅ This is done by writing 1 to the TASKS_EP0STATUS register.

NOTE: On Windows, you may get a `GET_STATUS` request *before* the `SET_CONFIGURATION` request and although you *should* respond to it, stalling the `GET_STATUS` request seems sufficient to get the device to the `Configured` state.

## Expected output

✅ Run the progam and check the log output.

Once you are correctly handling the `SET_CONFIGURATION` request you should get logs like these:

These logs are from a Linux host. You can find traces for other OSes in these files (they are in the `nrf52-code/traces` folder):

- `linux-configured.txt` (same logs as the ones shown above)
- `win-configured.txt`, this file only contains the logs produced by running `cargo xtask usb-descriptors`
- `macos-configured.txt`

You can find a solution to this part of the exercise in `nrf52-code/usb-app-solutions/src/bin/usb-5.rs`.
